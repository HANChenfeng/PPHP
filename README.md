This project is co-developed by Phoeny, Heman and Martin.

It is a web-based game with a keras model attached. The model intends to classify hand gestures and determine whether it is a rock, a paper or scissors.
To make the game a little more special, the team designed the game in a Chinese Kong Fu style (or Wu Xia style).
